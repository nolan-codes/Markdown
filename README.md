# Markdown
HTML squeezed into Markdown. Trying to keep the syntax minimal but retain the features. I need a real name for this project.

Make your project look kinda like test.html by including the script anywhere, 
then make "\<mrkdn\>" tags and put the markdown in there.
when you run it, it replaces that with 2 divs, one for the original (display set to none), and one for the new html

| *what sorta works*  | *what doesnt work* |
